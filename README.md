# Horiseon Optimization Refractor
## Introduction
Web accessibility is integral to web design as a mean of allowing individuals with certain disabilites to access websites using assistive technologies (screen readers, video captions, etc.). 
<br>
<br>
Thus, it is important for a website to utilize proper <strong>HTML Semantic Styles</strong> to enable these assitive technologies to aid users in navigating a website. 
<br>
<br>
For this activity, we were tasked with <strong>refactoring</strong> the previous HTML and CSS code of Horiseon, so it follows propert HTML semantic structure, as well as consolidating the CSS code into smaller, more manageable code.
